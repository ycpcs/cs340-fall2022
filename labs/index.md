This page lists the labs.

In order to receive credit for completing a lab, you need to get a sign-off from your instructor *in person*.  There are two options for this:

1. For 100% of full credit: Get a sign-off by the end of the *next* class (i.e., the class that follows the one in which we work on the lab in class.)
2. For 80% of full credit: Get a sign-off sometime before the next exam.

I *strongly* recommend that you work on the labs before you come to class, so that when you come to class, you have made a good start on it and are ready to ask questions about it.
